# IRP-pipeline
Collection of scripts that I used for ligand docking during my master's dissertation

Pipeline.py does most of the heavy lifting, by taking a CHEMBL dataset and converting IC50 into pIC50. Pubchem fingerprints are also generated, then both values were fed into a fairly standard random forest

The whole project could be a lot neater but I wasn't uploading them to Github as I did it and isntead threw them all onto Github at the end. I could proabably make this neater.
